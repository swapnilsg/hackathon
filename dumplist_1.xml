So it can hold 125oz at roughly 2A, Well how well this goes well in your application is depended on various factors, for example how heavy the gear is which is attached to the shaft of stepper motor, if you are planning to get more torque from your motor you can use a bigger gear and then use a slightly smaller gear to increase the rpm of the torque, Belt slippage happens when your RPM are to high or there is slack on the belt."

But you will obviously have to have well constructed questions requiring you to have done background reading. Your better option might be to find a forum specialising in matters relating to site contamination.  There must also be independent regulatory bodies that you can ask for info on practices, requirements etc. I have both up voted your question  and voted to close it, as it is not a suitable format for stack exchange but is a fair question."

That would be a tough problem even for significantly more equatorial latitudes.  I thought, and what seems reasonable, is that you want to get growing conditions in a greenhouse in summer like would be outdoors at a few 10s of degrees lower latitude.  Even that may be a stretch for solar-only.  Doing it in winter seems totally unreasonable at first knee-jerk reaction." CreationDate="2016-09-03T13:11:42.993" UserId="624" />
